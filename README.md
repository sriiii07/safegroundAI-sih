# SafeGround AI- AI-Powered Landslide Early Warning & Emergency Response Platform

🌍 Overview
SAFEGROUND AI is a full-stack, AI-driven disaster management platform designed to predict landslides 24 hours in advance and coordinate emergency response between government authorities and at-risk citizens. Built specifically for Kerala's vulnerable monsoon regions, the platform combines machine learning, real-time weather data, IoT sensor simulation, and intuitive interfaces to save lives before disasters strike.

The system serves two distinct user groups through purpose-built dashboards:

Government Authorities get a military-grade command center with AI-powered evacuation recommendations, resource allocation planning, and live risk monitoring
Citizens get a personal safety app with location-aware shelter navigation, emergency contacts, and one-tap safety status reporting
🚨 The Problem
Kerala experiences devastating landslides every monsoon season, resulting in catastrophic loss of life and displacement.

Historical Impact
Year	Event	Casualties	Displaced
2018	Kerala Floods	483 deaths	1.4 million
2019	Puthumala Landslide	40+ deaths	Hundreds
2020	Pettimudi Landslide	70+ deaths	Entire settlement
2024	Wayanad Landslide	231+ deaths	Thousands
Root Causes of High Casualty Rates
Manual monitoring — officers rely on rain gauges, soil reports, and news updates checked periodically
No centralized platform exists that combines prediction, coordination, and citizen response
Delayed warnings — by the time alerts are issued, roads are often already blocked
Fragmented information — authorities, rescue teams, and citizens operate on different systems
Poor last-mile communication — remote village residents may never receive alerts
💡 Our Solution
SAFEGROUND AI addresses these challenges through a unified platform that operates on standard smartphones and computers, requiring no specialized hardware.

Key Innovations
Predictive AI — Machine learning model forecasts landslide probability 24 hours before occurrence
Command Center Dashboard — Authorities receive AI-recommended actions with resource allocation
Citizen Safety App — Residents get personalized risk information and GPS-guided evacuation
Real-Time Monitoring — Live weather data, animated rain radar, and simulated IoT sensor network
Emergency Drill Mode — 60-second simulation demonstrates the full response workflow

🔐 Security
The platform implements industry-standard security practices:

JWT Token Authentication — All protected endpoints require valid tokens in the Authorization: Bearer header
bcrypt Password Hashing — Passwords are never stored in plain text, using bcrypt with salt
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) — Authorities and citizens have distinct permission scopes
CORS Protection — Backend explicitly allows only trusted frontend origins
Token Expiration — JWTs expire after a configured duration, requiring re-authentication
Input Validation — Pydantic models validate all incoming API requests
